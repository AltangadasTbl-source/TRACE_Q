Runtime routing confirmation: the mandatory curator responded, followed by six fresh named mapper agents. Runtime IDs are canonical task paths supplied by the collaboration runtime; no opaque UUID is exposed by this interface. Every actual runtime is recorded exactly once in the execution manifest. Project maximum of six concurrent specialists is respected.
