# Main Quantitative Evidence Map — Part 1

## Scope and provenance

Source DOC-001, role REPORT: `jama_courcoulas_2024_oi_240004_1721756962.76052.pdf`. Assigned main scope is physical PDF pages 1–11 (printed pages 654–664). This independent part owns physical pages 1–4 and 67 relationship records MAIN-001 through MAIN-067. Part 2 owns pages 5–11. Records reconstruct source evidence only; no findings or candidate judgments are assigned. Matching later occurrences are cross-references, not extra relationships in this part.

Read QUALITY_CONTROL_SCOPE.md and workflow_1_6_2/review_contract.md completely; read current source inventory, source coverage, evidence asset inventory and tooling record. Canonical locators are the reusable combined layout `.ai_paper_validation/review_1_5_3/preprocessing/main/DOC-001_pp1-11_direct_layout.txt` and per-page `.ai_paper_validation/document_outputs/DOC-001/preprocessing/normalized_text/page-NNN.txt`. Curator byte comparison with direct Poppler 26.01.0 extraction establishes unchanged native/layout transcription. Reused Poppler rendered PNG pages 3 and 4 were visually inspected, including every flow box and table row. Exact retained page text is appended below for independent reconstruction. No new extraction, rendering or OCR was necessary; compute device CPU; historical derivative engine Poppler-compatible native/layout and Poppler 200-dpi PNG, exact historical version unspecified. No prior candidate/checker/report scientific input was read.

Notation: M = medical/lifestyle; B = bariatric surgery; R = Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; S = sleeve gastrectomy; A = adjustable gastric banding. All intervals are printed 95% confidence intervals unless explicitly described as SD, IQR or range. Percent signs retain source usage; no conversion between percentage-point and relative-percent quantities is imposed. Group descriptions and quantitative scale footnotes are recorded verbatim in the appropriate fields.

                 IMPORTANCE Randomized clinical trials of bariatric surgery have been limited in size, type of                       Multimedia
                 surgical procedure, and follow-up duration.
                                                                                                                                     Supplemental content
                 OBJECTIVE To determine long-term glycemic control and safety of bariatric surgery compared
                 with medical/lifestyle management of type 2 diabetes.

                 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS ARMMS-T2D (Alliance of Randomized Trials of Medicine
                 vs Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes) is a pooled analysis from 4 US single-center
                 randomized trials conducted between May 2007 and August 2013, with observational
                 follow-up through July 2022.

                 INTERVENTION Participants were originally randomized to undergo either medical/lifestyle
                 management or 1 of the following 3 bariatric surgical procedures: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,
                 sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding.

                 MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
                 from baseline to 7 years for all participants. Data are reported for up to 12 years.

                 RESULTS A total of 262 of 305 eligible participants (86%) enrolled in long-term follow-up for
                 this pooled analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants was 49.9 (8.3) years, mean (SD) body
                 mass index was 36.4 (3.5), 68.3% were women, 31% were Black, and 67.2% were White.
                 During follow-up, 25% of participants randomized to undergo medical/lifestyle management
                 underwent bariatric surgery. The median follow-up was 11 years. At 7 years, HbA1c decreased
                 by 0.2% (95% CI, −0.5% to 0.2%), from a baseline of 8.2%, in the medical/lifestyle group and
                 by 1.6% (95% CI, −1.8% to −1.3%), from a baseline of 8.7%, in the bariatric surgery group.
                 The between-group difference was −1.4% (95% CI, −1.8% to −1.0%; P < .001) at 7 years and
                 −1.1% (95% CI, −1.7% to −0.5%; P = .002) at 12 years. Fewer antidiabetes medications were
                 used in the bariatric surgery group. Diabetes remission was greater after bariatric surgery
                 (6.2% in the medical/lifestyle group vs 18.2% in the bariatric surgery group; P = .02) at 7
                 years and at 12 years (0.0% in the medical/lifestyle group vs 12.7% in the bariatric surgery
                 group; P < .001). There were 4 deaths (2.2%), 2 in each group, and no differences in major
                 cardiovascular adverse events. Anemia, fractures, and gastrointestinal adverse events were
                 more common after bariatric surgery.

                 CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE After 7 to 12 years of follow-up, individuals originally randomized
                 to undergo bariatric surgery compared with medical/lifestyle intervention had superior glycemic
                 control with less diabetes medication use and higher rates of diabetes remission.

## Figure2 full displayed relationships

[DOC-001 p5 Figure2](../../../jama_courcoulas_2024_oi_240004_1721756962.76052.pdf#page=5). Annual visit x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 for every panel. The following arrays preserve every displayed contributor count in order. Lines/dots are model least-square estimates; boxplots are raw data; horizontal line=median,dot=mean,box=IQR,whiskers highest/lowest within1.5×IQR. Thus individual box boundaries/whisker tips are descriptive distributions, not printed confidence limits; numeric values of those graphical elements are not labeled. Full boxplots were visually inspected at every visit in all panels. Numerical least-square coordinates are not printed; exact model values must use corresponding tabular/narrative/supplementary evidence rather than pixel readings.

These distinctions retain model-based vs raw summaries and the quantity/null of each row (change-null0,ratio/OR-null1). Footnotes apply to the whole display and must be kept with any extracted row. Conversion factors are HbA1c×10.93−23.50;glucose×0.0555;cholesterol×0.0259;triglycerides×0.0113;creatinine×88.4. No outcome-specific n accompanies these table cells.

## Completeness and limits

All11 assigned physical pages have newly reconstructed mapping, all3 tables and all3 figures are represented, every printed quantitative table cell and figure contributor count is retained. No fresh-required extraction units;no scientific coverage gap. Unlabelled boxplot/least-square point coordinates in Figure2 and unlabelled remission dot coordinates in Figure3 lack printed exact values;images were inspected across every visit,coarse visual locators are marked,and exact narrated/tabulated values remain authoritative. This is a graphical display precision limitation,not omission. The complete source page text below preserves numeric footnotes/headings/background without creating findings or expanding scope to external literature.
