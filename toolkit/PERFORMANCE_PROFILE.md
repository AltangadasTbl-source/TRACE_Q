# Workflow 1.6.2 Performance Profile

This document is normative for workflow 1.6.2.

## Per-package planning target

Set the planning target separately for each paper package after inventory. Do not assume a fixed SAP
length, a fixed supplement length, or a fixed total page count. Count the actual supplied main article
and every support source in `source_coverage.md`, then consider:

- total source units;
- how many units require fresh direct-source mapping rather than reusable extraction;
- PDF, Office, workbook, or CSV complexity;
- OCR, conversion, and visual-table requirements;
- expected relationship volume and required agent waves.

Do not derive a target from page count alone and do not use universal `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, or `LARGE`
bands. Record a bounded package-specific explanation in `Target basis` and a positive `MIN-MAX` minute
range in `Target elapsed minutes`.

The completed workflow 1.4.1 run is one calibration point only: that package contained five PDFs with
102 total pages across the main article and all support files, of which 81 pages initially lacked
reusable extraction. It finished in 49.4 minutes after a coverage repair and two statistical reruns.
A 35-50 minute target may be reasonable for a future package with comparable total scope, missing-
derivative burden, and review complexity. It is not a default for other packages and says nothing
about the expected length of an SAP.

Retain each clean workflow 1.6.2 observation as future calibration evidence. The target is not a hard
timeout and never permits omitted sources, relationships, statistical pass 2, screening decisions, candidates,
evidence rechecks, quality review, links, or report cards. Record bounded causes whenever the selected upper
bound is exceeded.

## Reasoning-effort allocation

Every role uses one run model, by default `gpt-6.1-sol` (see "Run model selection" in AGENTS.md).
Roles differ only in reasoning effort.

| Role class | Model | Reasoning effort | Start requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coordinator | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `high` | Current coordinator session |
| Statistical consistency pass 1 | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `high` | New specialist agent |
| Statistical consistency pass 2 | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `high` | Different new specialist agent |
| Inclusion screen (initial, and pass 2 when pass 2 emits findings) | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `high` | New specialist agent for each screen |
| Mechanical evidence recheck and classification confirmation | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `high` | New specialist when delegated |
| Final evidence-quality and classification audit | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `high` | New specialist when delegated |
| All other specialist roles (asset curation, mapping, numeric and cross-source checks, report generation) | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `medium` | New specialist when delegated |

Never ask an existing medium-effort agent through a follow-up message to act as a high-effort
statistical reviewer. Spawn each statistical pass with explicit model `gpt-6.1-sol` and reasoning
effort `high`. The two passes use distinct runtime agent IDs and read durable artifacts rather than
shared chat context. Record both executions in `agent_execution_manifest.md`.

Do not silently raise a medium-effort role above this table. A one-off escalation requires a concrete
failed check or unresolved relationship recorded in `run_state.md` and a new explicitly configured
agent.

## Latency rules

1. Run main/support mapping concurrently after one asset inventory and one coverage plan.
2. Run numeric, statistical pass 1, and cross-source review concurrently after mapping.
3. Reuse durable canonical artifacts; do not ask a later agent to reread unrelated source units.
4. Split only when the configured context bound would be exceeded, never to distribute a desired
   finding count.
5. Do not repeat OCR, Office conversion, extraction, a calculation, or a source-page confirmation when
   a current source-matched artifact already records it.
6. Run one inclusion screen after all three checkers finish, and a second screen only for findings
   from statistical pass 2.
7. Generate report-card shards only when one report call would exceed its context bound. Otherwise generate the
   complete report in one call and render HTML once after Markdown stabilizes.
8. Return compact agent statuses; complete evidence remains in artifacts rather than chat transcripts.

## Timing record

The coordinator records these exact fields in the versioned `run_state.md`:

```markdown
- **Target basis:** BOUNDED PACKAGE-SPECIFIC EXPLANATION
- **Total source units:** INTEGER
- **Fresh-source units:** INTEGER
- **Target elapsed minutes:** MIN-MAX
- **Started UTC:** YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
- **Finished UTC:** YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
- **Observed elapsed minutes:** NUMBER
- **Target status:** MET_TARGET or EXCEEDED_TARGET
- **Exceedance causes:** None, or a bounded semicolon-separated list
```

`Total source units` and `Fresh-source units` must equal the sums in `source_coverage.md`. The target
range must use positive whole minutes with the lower bound below the upper bound. `Finished UTC` and
`Observed elapsed minutes` are captured immediately after the complete Markdown report is assembled.
Copy all finalized fields into the report, render HTML once, and run the mechanical validator. Local
rendering and validation are excluded from observed review duration so timing does not require a
second report-generation wave.

Local HTML rendering and mechanical validation do not use the model and remain outside the review
window. If a validation repair requires a later model response, move `Finished UTC` forward and update
the timing fields in `run_state.md` and the report.

Finish complete work even when elapsed time exceeds the selected upper bound. Never convert the
planning target into sampling, early stopping, a candidate cap, or incomplete coverage.
